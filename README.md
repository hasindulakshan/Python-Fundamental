# 🐍 Python Beginner Course: Basic Data Structures

Welcome to the **Python Beginner Course**, where you'll dive into basic data structures, conditional statements, loops, and more.

In this course, you'll master fundamental data structures in Python such as **dictionaries**, **lists**, **sets**, and **tuples**. These structures are crucial for organizing and manipulating data effectively in your Python programs.

## 📚 Course Contents:

### 1. 📋 Lists in Python
- **Lists** are ordered collections of items that allow duplicates and are mutable.
- **Operations**:
  - 🆕 Creating lists
  - 🔍 Accessing elements
  - ✂️ Slicing lists
  - ✏️ Modifying lists
  - 🛠️ List methods
  
### 2. 📦 Tuples
- **Tuples** are ordered collections of items that are immutable.
- **Operations**:
  - 🆕 Creating tuples
  - 🔍 Accessing elements
  - ✏️ Modifying tuples (indirectly, by creating new tuples)
  
### 3. 🔑 Dictionaries
- **Dictionaries** are unordered collections of key-value pairs.
- **Operations**:
  - 🆕 Creating dictionaries
  - 🔍 Accessing elements by key
  - ✏️ Adding and modifying elements
  - 🛠️ Dictionary methods
  
### 4. 🔗 Sets
- **Sets** are unordered collections of unique elements.
- **Operations**:
  - 🆕 Creating sets
  - ➕ Adding and ➖ removing elements
  - ⚙️ Set operations: union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference
